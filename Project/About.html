  <p>Picross puzzles look like grids of squares with numbers above and to the left.
     Each number tells you that there is group of consecutive black squares
     somewhere in that row or column. For example, a 5 above a column means that
     somewhere in that column, there is a group of five black squares with no
     spaces between them.</p>

  <p>If there is more than one number for a row or column, it means that there
    are multiple groups of black squares, separated by at least one white square.
</p>
<p>
You must use logic to figure out which squares should be filled in, and which
 should stay blank. When you solve the puzzle, the grid will have a picture in
  it. This tutorial will teach you some Picross puzzle solving techniques.</p>
