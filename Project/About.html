    <h1>How to Play Picross</h1>
    <p>
        Picross is a puzzle game where the player must color blocks on a grid according to numbers next to each column and row. Each number tells you how many consecutive blocks need to be colored in that column/row without breaks. For example, a clue saying "4 8 3" would indicate that the row contains 4 filled blocks, then 8 filled blocks, then 3 filled blocks all separated by breaks in that order.
